# Marks  
__SS__: self-study;  
__AD__: auditing, which means I attended the class and all related activities as a normal student but earned no credits;  
__MA__: this course is in the Department of Mathematics at HKUST;  
~~__OG__: ongoing;~~  
~~__IP__: in plan;~~

# Aparecium
I Finished 40 credits officially in the first one and a half years of my MPhil.  
Most courses I learned are based on my interests since a high GPA via carefully selected courses is not needed for a postgraduate researcher.  
Some courses I learned are to boost my research, some are from my friends' suggestions (usually my friends are also researchers).  
A few courses I have to self-study via material from other universities, as there are no such related courses at HKUST.  
~~I do not want to take any course in the last semester...Just~~ DO RESEARCH!!!!‚è∞üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  

### By the way:  
The Minimum Credit Requirement in HKUST is:   
15 credits for MPhil in Robotics and Autonomous Systems  
/ 12 credits for PhD in Physics  
/ 15 credits for PhD in Electronic and Computer Engineering  
/ 16 credits for MPhil in Computer Science and Engineering  
/ 19 credits for PhD in Computer Science and Engineering  
/ 24 credits for MPhil in Mathematics  
/ 36 credits for PhD in Mathematics
