## Liangyawei Kuang/匡梁亚伟 here! 

I am a graduate student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) who focuses on the intersection of control, vision, and machine learning to develop algorithms and techniques that can endow machines with the ability to autonomously acquire the skills for executing complex multi-agent tasks. In particular, I am interested in how learning can be used to acquire complex behavioral skills, to endow machines with greater autonomy and intelligence. (hahaha, this paragraph is plagiarizing superstar, [Sergey Levine](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/)'s intro :D)

Besides this one, my another personal webpage is at [deadsecond.com](https://www.deadsecond.com)
While both of them are urder building.
