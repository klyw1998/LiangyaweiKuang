## About Me 
I am a postgraduate researcher at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST) who focuses on the intersection of reinforcement learning, decision-theoretic planning, and multi-agent systems to develop algorithms and techniques that can endow machines with the ability to autonomously acquire the skills for executing complex group tasks. In particular, I am interested in how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning can be used to acquire swarm behavioral skills, to endow machines with greater autonomy and intelligence. (lol, this paragraph is somehow plagiarizing a Berkeley superstar, [Sergey Levine](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/)'s intro :D)
